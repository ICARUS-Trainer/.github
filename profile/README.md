# ICARUS Trainer

On ICARUS, the planet does not forgive.
It remembers every misstep, every storm faced unprepared, every breath taken too late. **ICARUS Trainer** exists not to silence that danger—but to *negotiate* with it, quietly, intelligently, inside the unforgiving expanse of ICARUS.

This is not domination.
It is preparation.

## 🌫️ Philosophy of Survival

ICARUS is not cruel—it is honest. It tests preparation, patience, and adaptation. The trainer does not erase that truth. It lets you **decide which lessons matter**, and which repetitions no longer serve you.

Use it to:

* Practice late-game expeditions
* Test base designs against storms
* Explore biomes without restarting missions

Or simply to breathe, and look at the horizon.

For survivors who know control is quiet.

Step onto the surface prepared.
Let the planet test something worthy.
